Objective: Complete 8 Splunk analysis tasks.


Task 1
Most used git command.
  (Sample search 4)
  (The search)
    index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=1 user=eddie 
    | stats count by CommandLine 
    | sort - count

Answer: git status


Task 2
Remote repo used as the origin for the 'partnerapi' repo (the correct one).
  (Same search from Task 1)
  (Ctrl+F "origin" has these results:)
    git remote add origin git@github.com:elfnp3/partnerapi.git
    git remote add origin https://github.com/elfnp3/partnerapi.git
    git remote remove origin
  (One is wrong so removed, click on each add event to see the time.)
  (The latter one is the correct one.)

Answer: git@github.com:elfnp3/partnerapi.git


Task 3
The 'partnerapi' project uses docker. Full docker command to start the project.
  (Same search from Task 1)
  (Ctrl+F "docker")
  (Google search each command for what they do)

Answer: docker compose up


Task 4
Been testing automated static application security testing (SAST) in GitHub. Vuln report received as JSON via GitHub webhooks. Name of vuln GitHub repo cloned for testing.
  (Sample search 6)
  (The search)
    index=main sourcetype=github_json
  (Use "All Fields" in the sidebar to find interesting fields)
  (Alert message text field containing "vulnerability" is interesting)
  (Add to search)
  (reposity.name field has the answer)

Answer: dvws-node


Task 5
JavaScript library added from NPM to the 'partnerapi' project?
  (Same search from Task 1)
  (Ctrl+F "npm")
    node /usr/bin/npm install holiday-utils-js

Answer: holiday-utils-js


Task 6
From baseline of network activity generated, what full process_name is sus?
  (https://hhc21.bossworkshops.io/en-US/app/SA-hhc/search?q=search%20index%3Dmain%20sourcetype%3Djournald%20source%3DJournald%3AMicrosoft-Windows-Sysmon%2FOperational%20EventCode%3D3%20user%3Deddie%20NOT%20dest_ip%20IN%20(127.0.0.*)%20NOT%20dest_port%20IN%20(22%2C53%2C80%2C443)%20%0A%7C%20stats%20count%20by%20dest_ip%20dest_port&display.page.search.mode=smart&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&workload_pool=&earliest=0&latest=now&sid=1688088422.27&display.page.search.tab=statistics&display.general.type=statistics)
  (The search)
    index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=3 user=eddie NOT dest_ip IN (127.0.0.*) NOT dest_port IN (22,53,80,443) 
    | stats count by dest_ip dest_port
  (Result)
    dest_ip		dest_port	count
    192.30.255.113	9418		2
    54.175.69.219	16842		1
  (Port 9418 looks like used by git)
  (Port 16842 is no reversed.)
  (process_exec and process_name has stuff about nc.openbsd)
  (First recommended google search when typing nc openbsd is about reverse shell)

Answer: /usr/bin/nc.openbsd


Task 7
Parent process of the one in task 6. Other child processes spawned and how many files accessed?
  (PID from task 6 = 6791)
  (The search)
    index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational PID=6791
  (All Fields sidebar => parent_process_id = 6788)
  (New search)
    index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational parent_process_id=6788
  (Other process has PID = 6790)
  (CommandLine has cat linux command on 6 different files)

Answer: 6


Task 8
Use Splunk and Sysmon Process creation data to ID the sus Bast script.
  (The search to look at the parent process)
    index=main sourcetype=journald source=Journald:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational PID=6788
  (One event has ParentCommandLine=/bin/bash preinstall.sh)

Answer: preinstall.sh
