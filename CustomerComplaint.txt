  https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3514


1) Use wireshark filter: ip.flags.rb == 1
2) See some packets about POST requests to guest complaint pages.
3) Use wireshark filter: ip.flags.rb == 1 && http.request.uri == "/feedback/guest_complaint.php"
4) See the complaints in the form data.
5) RClick on a column header > Column Preferences >
  5a) [plus sign] to add new
  5a) Fields = urlencoded-form.value
  5a) Field Occurrence = 3
  5b) (Optional to see the actual complaint) Repeat adding with Field Occurrence = 4
6) Formdata occurrence 3 has the room number for the guest.
7a) Room 1024 is the only one that appeared three times.
7b) That person also accessed the guest complaint page with ip.flags.rb != 1
7c) The evil bit in the IPv4 header is an April Fools joke. Here, the trolls have it set and the human doesn't have it set.
8) Other parts of the formdata (occurrence 1) has the troll names.
