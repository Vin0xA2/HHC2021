Summary:
  1) Start a marshalsec LDAP server to point the malicious Java Class
  2) Create the malicious Java Class on web port 8080 to shovel a shell to Netcat listener on TCP port 4444.
  3) Access the target with a dummy URL parameter to let Log4j misinterpret it and connect to the LDAP server.
  4) Netcat listener gains shell access and can just read the target file for the answer.
